    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn the process of data cleaning, we will use NASA's meteorite landings dataset. But before that, let's learn about a meteoroid, meteor, and meteorite to properly interpret the meteorite landings dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a meteoroid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A meteoroid is a solid rock-like object that gets separated from its parent body in outer space mostly due collision of asteroids which are humongous in size. It travels through the solar system and comes close to Earth. It's also referred to as a near-Earth object. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a meteor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A meteor, otherwise known as a shooting star or fireball, is a meteoroid that fires up and radiates energy when enters Earth's atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a meteorite?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A meteorite is a meteor that falls on the earth's surface or ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the image shown below to understand the difference between the three objects. They are the same object but named differently based on their location.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why are meteorites important to scientists**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the meteorites called chondrites contain chondrules. A chondrule is a mineral grain and spherical. They were formed at the time of the birth of the solar system. Studying chondrules will help us understand the formation of the solar system. Hence, meteorites are important to scientists. The image below shows chondrules on a microscopic scale.\n",

    "#### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Meteoritical Society](https://meteoritical.org/) collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth from outer space. The dataset contains the following variables for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `name`: The name of the place where a meteorite was found or observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `id`: A unique identifier for a meteorite.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `nametype`: One of the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `valid`: A typical meteorite.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `relict`: A meteorite that has been highly degraded by the weather on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `recclass`: The class of the meteorite; one of a large number of classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. You can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification) to learn about the meteorite classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Meteorite Type 1: Iron and Stony-iron meteorites. You can read about them in your free time after the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/lesson-19/types-of-meteorite-1.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Image source: https://spacecentre.co.uk/blog-post/edible-meteorites/*\n",

    "\n",
    "    *Image source: https://spacecentre.co.uk/blog-post/edible-meteorites/*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `mass:` The mass of the meteorite, in grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `fall`: Whether the meteorite was seen falling, or was discovered after its impact; one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Fell`: The meteorite's fall was observed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `Found`: The meteorite's fall was not observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `year`: The year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (depending on the value of the fell).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `reclat`: The latitude of the meteorite's landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `reclong`: The longitude of the meteorite's landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `GeoLocation`: A parentheses-enclose, comma-separated tuple that combines reclat and reclong.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to memorize this list of variables. You can refer to it whenever you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was downloaded from [NASA's Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)  (the link may take more time to open), and is based on [The Meteoritical Society's Meteoritical Bulletin Database](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/). The latter database provides additional information such as meteorite images, links to primary sources, etc."

    "\n",
    "The columns such as `recclass`, `reclat`, `reclong` begin with the `rec` keyword. It's a shorthand for *recommended*. They are the recommended values of the classes, latitudes, and longitudes variables for the meteorites according to the Meteoritical Society. \n",

    "A few values in the `year` column were incorrectly entered into the dataset. Any year less than 860 or greater than 2016 is incorrect. It must be removed from the dataset. \n",

    "A few entries have latitude and longitude of `0N/0E` (off the western coast of Africa, where it would be quite difficult to recover meteorites). Many of these were actually discovered in Antarctica, but exact coordinates were not given. \n"
