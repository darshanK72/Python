Therefore, it means a string also stores data. Essentially, a string is an array containing some items. Any character (whether a letter, a number, or a special symbol like space, brackets, etc.) enclosed within double quotes (`\"\"`) or single quotes (`''`) is considered as a string. \n",

This is such a big hassle if too many strings are to be concatenated.\n",
